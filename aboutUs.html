            JEROME BURNS<br>I am a native of Seattle. I enjoy physical activity, gardening, and classic texts.<br>Professionally Iâ€™ve spent 20 years working locally to provide affordable rental housing. My work involves partnering with nonprofits, service
            providers, and local public agencies to help build housing that is affordable at all income levels.<br>My interest in programming stems in part from my work and my natural interest which leans toward the quantitative and analytical. I would
            like to develop products which gather and synthesize data to more effectively address human needs, particularly housing. My goal would be to work with a team who are passionate about creating tools that help address basic human needs, such
            as housing, more effectively.

            CINDY WEISS<br>I am a wife, a mother, and a woman completely in love with learning. I love to learn new things and processes. I hold degrees in both culinary arts and in business management. I also have a background in accounting and am eligible
            to sit for the CPA exam. I am currently learning web development at Code Fellows. <br> I thrive in open and fun environments and enjoy opportunities to learn from my peers. I have a history of being able to meet firm deadlines but truly believe
            lasting outcomes are more about the process than one ending product.
