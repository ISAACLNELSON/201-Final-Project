            CINDY WEISS <br> I am a wife, a mother, and a woman completely in love with learning. I love to learn new things and processes. I hold degrees in both culinary arts and in business management. I also have a background in accounting and am
            eligible to sit for the CPA exam. I am currently learning web development at Code Fellows. <br> I thrive in open and fun environments and enjoy opportunities to learn from my peers. I have a history of being able to meet firm deadlines but
            truly believe lasting outcomes are more about the process than one ending product.

            My name is Jerome Burns. I am a native of Seattle. I enjoy physical activity, gardening, and classic texts. I have an undergraduate degree in political science and graduate degree in administration. </br>Professionally Iâ€™ve spent 20 years
            developing affordable rental housing. My skills and experience include project management and quantitative analysis.</b> I want to be a programmer to develop products which gather and synthesize data more effectively. My goal would be to work
            with a team who is passionate about creating tools that better paint a visual picture and help develop more efficient solutions.
