  <p class="jerome">
    JEROME BURNS<br>I am a native of Seattle. I enjoy physical activity, gardening, and classic texts.<br>
    Professionally Iâ€™ve spent 20 years working locally to provide affordable rental housing. My work involves partnering
    with nonprofits,
    service providers, and local public agencies to help build housing that is affordable at all income levels.<br>My
    interest in programming stems in part from my work and my natural passion which leans toward the quantitative and
    analytical. I enjoy
    developing financial models to solve and structure a deal. I enjoy studying demographics and policy to understand
    how they shape growth and housing needs.<br>I want to be a programmer to help develop products which gather and
    synthesize data to
    more effectively address human needs, particularly housing. My goal would be to work with a team who are passionate
    about creating these tools that help address basic human needs such as housing more effectively.

    CINDY WEISS<br>I am a wife, a mother, and a woman completely in love with learning. I love to learn new things and
    processes. I
    hold degrees in both culinary arts and in business management. I also have a background in accounting and am
    eligible to sit for the CPA exam. I am currently learning web development at Code Fellows. <br>
    I thrive in open and fun environments and
    enjoy opportunities to learn from my peers. I have a history of being able to meet firm deadlines but truly believe
    lasting outcomes are more about the process than one ending product.
