            JEROME BURNS<br>I am a native of Seattle. I enjoy physical activity, gardening, and classic texts. Professionally Iâ€™ve spent 20 years working locally to build affordable rental housing for those with the greatest need. My passion and interest
            is to solve problems through quantitative and analytical means. I want to be a developer of products which gather and synthesize data more effectively. My goal would be to work with a team equally passionate about creating tools with focus
            on addressing social needs more effectively.

            CINDY WEISS<br>I am a wife, a mother, and a woman completely in love with learning. I love to learn new things and processes. I hold degrees in both culinary arts and in business management. I also have a background in accounting and am eligible
            to sit for the CPA exam. I am currently learning web development at Code Fellows. <br> I thrive in open and fun environments and enjoy opportunities to learn from my peers. I have a history of being able to meet firm deadlines but truly believe
            lasting outcomes are more about the process than one ending product.

            PETER COLE<br>
            I am a web development student at Code Fellows, I would like to be employed at a smaller outdoor industry company contracting to serve their web development needs, pursuing full time employment. I love to work in a community driven and empowering work environment. 
            My background includes French, music education, geology, tree care, residential painting, electrician apprenticeship, and several years volunteering as a mountain guide for a nonprofit. Software development, an early hobby in high school, 
            has called me back for its ability to touch all of the fields that I am passionate about and provide me an outlet to express my creativity and work ethic surrounded by like-minded people. I am excited to learn more about contributing to this community.
