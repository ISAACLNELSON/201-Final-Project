        My name is Jerome Burns. I am a native of Seattle. I enjoy physical activity, gardening, and classic texts.<br> Professionally Iâ€™ve spent 20 years working locally to provide affordable rental housing. My work involves partnering with nonprofits,
        service providers, and local public agencies to help build housing that is affordable at all income levels.<br>My interest in programming stems in part from my work and my natural passion which leans toward the quantitative and analytical. I enjoy
        developing financial models to solve and structure a deal. I enjoy studying demographics and policy to understand how they shape growth and housing needs.<br>I want to be a programmer to help develop products which gather and synthesize data to
        more effectively address human needs, particularly housing. My goal would be to work with a team who are passionate about creating these tools that help address basic human needs such as housing more effectively.
