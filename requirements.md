## Software Requirements


### Vision:

Our vision is to create a version of the game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using vanilla JavaScript coding to animate the game. 

What pain point does this project solve:
This project was designed to offer a brief respite from the day to day struggles of students learning code here at Code Fellows. It provides a fun outlet to de-stress. 

Why should we care about your product?
You should care about this product because it showcases what a student coming out of Code 201 is capable of creating at the 201 level. It is also very fun to play!

### Scope (In/Out)

*IN:*  The game will allow each player to play against a random computer generated move.

1. The web application will allow a player to play against the computer the best out of 5 games.
2. The web application will have animated buttons and at the end of each game will display the winer.
3. The web application will provide a form for users to fill out a user id if they wish to store their scores in local storeage.
4. The web application will have a page that provides a table of all previously stored user id's and their scores. This table will show the top three users by putting awards next to their player ids.

*OUT:* What web application will _not_ do.

1. This web application will not allow two player battles at this time.
2. This web application will never turn into an IOS or Android app.

### MVP

Our minium viable project is a completly functional game. The game will run the best out of 5 games and then render a winner. If winner is user it will then prompt user to create a user I.D. and store their scores. The web application will then render a table on the "High Scores" page containing all stored scores and their corresponding player names as well as indicated top three scores by an award image.

### Stretch

What stretch goals are you going to aim for?
1. Take the game board out of CSS annimation and into phaser.
2. Add sound to the game.

### Functional Requirements

Page will load right into game mode with instructions displayed above game board.
All navigation keys will indeed navigate successfully between the three pages.
A user can create a user ID that can then be attached to their current score.
That score is then saved to local data and can be pulled down into a chart displaying top scores and user IDs for all users to access. Button to clear local data.
